## Urban Sounds Classification

Every day we hear different sounds from different sources. We can recognize several random examples of sounds from the environment such as an ambulance, an engine or an airplane. But can we train a computer to classify these random sounds? If the answer is yes, it could be used for surveillance and monitoring or for other environmental researches such as the urban sound pollution in the cities, and it can be applied to the general audio recognition as well. The objective of this paper is to create a suited machine learning technique to classify urban sounds accurately. The dataset used is the UrbanSound8K audio dataset, comprised of 8732 audio clips of urban sounds divided in 10 classes. Two different approaches are followed: one using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) fed with raw data of extracted features of sound and one using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) fed with images of the spectrums of sound. After testing the models with 5-fold cross validation, the algorithm that performed the best was the Artificial Neural Network, when paired with the use of 40 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as input features.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85356795/192889814-ead9c632-c7f8-46dc-953e-0ca80e0617fd.png)
